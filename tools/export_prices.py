"""Export NPC sell prices, weights and item types for every item monsters drop (data/loot.js) into data/prices.js,
data/weights.js and data/itemtypes.js.

    python tools/export_prices.py            # fetch what isn't cached, then write data/prices.js, data/weights.js and data/itemtypes.js
    python tools/export_prices.py --refresh  # refetch every item (prices changed after a patch)

Prices come from rozerodb.com's item API (/api/items/<id>: buy_price, sell_price), the site data/loot.js came from, so
they should add up to its loot value per kill. Not from rAthena: its prices don't match RO Zero.
Items are fetched one per second and cached in tools/cache/ (gitignored). Delete a cached file to refetch it.
Items rozerodb has no sell price for are written as null (roz.prontera.info and ragnarokzero.net had none for the ones checked either).
Weights come from the same records (weight). rozerodb may store them in tenths like the game files (Jellopy 10) or as
shown in game (Jellopy 1): Jellopy (909) weighs 1 in game, so its record sets the scale. Items with no weight count as 0.
Cached records from before weights were exported have no weight: run with --refresh once.
Item types follow the in-game auto-loot (Looting tab) groups; see loot_type().
Then it checks every monster: sum(sell x chance / 100) over its drops should round to LOOT[id][0]. It prints how many
match, the worst mismatches, and the items it couldn't price.
