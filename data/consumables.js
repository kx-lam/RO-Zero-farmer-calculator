// Items that skills and attacks use up, by item id: [name, NPC buy price (zeny), weight as shown in game]. From rAthena's renewal item_db (Buy, Weight / 10),
// since rozerodb (where the other price tables come from) has no buy prices exported yet. TODO: check the prices against RO Zero's NPC shops
// (rozerodb /api/items/<id>: buy_price) — rAthena's prices don't always match Zero. The weights match data/weights.js where an item is in both.
// Each player can type their own price per item in the Character tab (saved per job), which replaces these.
